The script in this repo analyzes data comprised of traded stocks spanning across 2014 through 2016. It was written to group all the different tickers individually and calculate: 

(1) Yearly changeâ€”which is also color coded according to whether they closed above or below their opening price for the year 
(2) Yearly change expressed as a percentage
(3) Total volume for each trading year. 

In addition, it highlights the stocks that had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume.
